Frame 1:
	This is our home, planet earth
	Sustaining life since ages
	It provides us with air to breath, food to eat and shelter to live

Frame 2:
	Now moving towards the most important region of our planet
	Polar Ice Caps
	This region have ability to change climatic conditions of whole planet
	
Frame 3:
	These are the polar ice caps
	present at the north pole and south pole of the planet
	These are the only fresh water source on our planet
	
Frame 4:
	About 50% of fresh water is present in the form of ice
	These polar ice caps are home to many animals and 
	Act as one of the ecosystem for flora and fauna
	
Frame 5:
	Industries, vehicles and other human activities release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere
	Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, Sulphur dioxide and methane
	
Frame 6:
	These greenhouses gases form a thick layer above earth's atmosphere
	These gases are responsible for greenhouse effect
	Layer of greenhouse gases is becoming thicker
	
Frame 7:
	Sun rays that falls on earth are trapped within the atmosphere
	Which causes the global rise in temperature of the planet
	
Frame 8:
	This effect is called greenhouse effect and the phenomenon is called global warming
	It increases the temperature at the poles
	Resulting in melting of polar ice caps
	
Frame 9:
	Ice melts at the poles and on the mountains
	Forming glaciers
	Which in turn raises the mean sea level
	and destroys lives of many plants and animals
